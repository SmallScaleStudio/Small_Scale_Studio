                        <p>"Aris Bellatrix, the daughter of a CEO, admires her best friend Rene's normal life and wants to stick with her forever. Unlike her fancy upbringing, Aris prefers simplicity and values friendship most. Even though her family is rich, she doesn't care much for it and just wants a simple life. Drumming in a band is her passion, but her dad doesn't like it because he thinks it's too tomboyish, even though Aris doesn't see herself that way. Despite all this, Aris stays easygoing and funny, hiding her inner struggles behind a cheerful attitude."</p>

She's always there for Aris, offering advice and support without hesitation. While she's wise beyond her years, Rene is also aware of her own imperfections. Still, she always does her best, especially when it comes to being there for Aris, whom she values deeply."</p>
